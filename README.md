### Foghlaim (verb): Irish for "to learn" 

You know how (as a developer) you sometimes come across an issue, you google the thing and the first few results are already purple? Sometimes you remember what project you ran into the issue. But if youre a consultant like I am, you frequently dont have access to the old code bases. 

Foghlaim is a personal "repo" meant to store the solutions that worked last time. You can post images, code snippets, and links to resources that helped you fix the issue last time. Except when you solve an odd issue you save what your fix was. The next time you can search in foghlaim and find what you did last time.
